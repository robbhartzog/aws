AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or  
usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount. Difference with CloudWatch  
Billing Alarms: CloudWatch Billing Alarms only send alerts when your costs and usage are  
exceeding your budget, not when it is forecasted to exceed your budget, while AWS Budgets  
does both.
