**CloudTrail** is used for **auditing** - to monitor API calls in AWS platform (e.g. which user  
provisioned which resources).

**AWS CloudTrail Insights** helps AWS users identify andrespond to unusual activity associated  
with write API calls by continuously analyzing CloudTrail management events.

By default, CloudTrail event log files are encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption  
(SSE). You can also choose to encrypt your log files with an AWS Key Management Service  
(AWS KMS) key.
