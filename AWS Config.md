You can use AWS Config to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS  
resources. AWS Config cannot alert you about console sign-in events that involve the AWS  
account root user.

AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of  
your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource  
configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against  
desired configurations. With Config, you can review changes in configurations and relationships  
between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine your  
overall compliance against the configurations specified in your internal guidelines.
