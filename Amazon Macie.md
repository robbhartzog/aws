Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security service that uses Machine Learning to discover  
and protect your sensitive data stored in S3 buckets. It automatically provides an inventory of  
S3 buckets including a list of unencrypted buckets, publicly accessible buckets, and buckets  
shared with other AWS accounts. It allows you to identify and alert you to sensitive data, such  
as Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
