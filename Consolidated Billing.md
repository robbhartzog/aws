Consolidated billing is a feature of AWS Organizations. You can combine the usage across all  
accounts in your organization to share volume pricing discounts, Reserved Instance discounts,  
and Savings Plans. This solution can result in a lower charge compared to the use of individual  
standalone accounts.
