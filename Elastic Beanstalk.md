● With Elastic Beanstalk you can quickly deploy, manage and scale applications in the AWS  
cloud without worrying about infrastructure that runs those applications.  
● services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on  
familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.  
● You simply upload the application and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles details of  
capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling and application health monitoring.  
● You do still need to deploy within a VPC. You can provision your Elastic beanstalk resources  
in an existing VPC (Beanstalk does not create VPC)

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment,  
from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the  
same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can  
access the underlying resources at any time.
