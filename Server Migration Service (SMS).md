AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agentless service which makes it easier and faster  
for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. AWS SMS allows you to  
automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier  
for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations. Currently, you can migrate virtual machines  
from VMware vSphere and Windows Hyper-V to AWS using AWS Server Migration Service.

AWS SMS is being discontinued as of March 31, 2022. Going forward, AWS recommends  
Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) as the primary migration service for lift-and-shift  
migrations.
