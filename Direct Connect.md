To avoid a single point of failure, you need to consider using two different direct connect  
locations for critical workloads. This will protect you from device failures and direct connect  
location outages.

A Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) is used to set up an AWS VPN which you can use in  
combination with Direct Connect to encrypt all data that traverses the Direct Connect link. This  
combination provides an IPsec-encrypted private connection that also reduces network costs,  
increases bandwidth throughput, and provides a more consistent network experience than  
internet-based VPN connections.
