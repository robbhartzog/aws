High Availability means the system is up and available but it may perform in a degraded state  
(i.e. SLA may not be met).

Fault Tolerance means the user does not experience any impact from a fault. The SLA is always  
met.

Hence Fault Tolerance is ahigher barthan High Availability.

AMI IDs are different across regions.

RTO = Recovery Time Objective(time it takes for asystem to recover and come back online again)

RPO = Recovery Point Objective(how much data is lostif the system fails)

Expect that everything will fail at some point and design accordingly
