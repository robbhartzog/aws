An Edge-Optimized API Gateway is best for geographically distributed clients. API requests are  
routed to the nearest CloudFront Edge Location which improves latency. The API Gateway still  
lives in one AWS Region.

You can use API Gateway REST API to create a proxy for the DynamoDB query API or other  
AWS services.
