AWS Cost Explorer enables you to view and analyze your costs and usage. You can view data  
for up to the last 12 months, forecast how much you are likely to spend for the next 12 months,  
and get recommendations for what EC2 reserved instances to purchase.

AWS Cost Explorer helps you identify under-utilized EC2 instances that may be downsized on  
an instance by instance basis within the same instance family, and also understand the potential  
impact on your AWS bill by taking into account your Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.
