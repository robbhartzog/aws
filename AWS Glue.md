● Serverless data-preparation service for extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations.  
● AWS **Glue Data Catalog** is a central repository to storestructural and operational metadata  
for all your data assets. For a given data set, you can store its table definition, physical  
location, add business relevant attributes, as well as track how this data has changed over  
time.  
● AWS Glue ETL jobs can use Amazon S3, data stores in a VPC, or on-premises JDBC data  
stores as a source. AWS Glue jobs extract data, transform it, and load the resulting data  
back to S3, data stores in a VPC, or on-premises JDBC data stores as a target.
